# SMS Spam Classification
# 📊 Project Overview
Spam messages pose a significant issue in today's digital communication. This project aims to classify SMS messages as either spam or legitimate using machine learning techniques, enabling efficient filtering of unwanted messages.

# 🚀 Features
End-to-end machine learning pipeline:

* Data Preprocessing
* Text Feature Extraction using TF-IDF Vectorizer
* Model Training & Evaluation
* Best Model Selection

# 🔍 Comparison of Models:
* Naive Bayes
* Logistic Regression
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)

# 🛠️ Technologies Used
* Programming Language: Python
* Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib

# 📂 Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains SMS messages labeled as "spam" or "ham" (legitimate). The data was preprocessed to remove noise and extract meaningful text features.

# How to Run the Project
1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/Gayathri1404/SMS-Spam-Classification.git  
cd SMS-Spam-Classification  

2. Install Dependencies
Ensure you have Python installed, then install the required libraries:
pip install -r requirements.txt  
Run the Script
python spam_msg.py  

# 📈 Results
Achieved high accuracy using Support Vector Machine (SVM) as the best-performing model.
Successfully classified SMS messages as spam or ham with precision and recall optimization.

# 📌 Key Insights
* Using TF-IDF Vectorization directly on SMS text provided effective feature extraction for classification.
* Models like Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Logistic Regression performed well with minimal preprocessing.

# 🎯 Future Enhancements
Integrating the model into an email or SMS filtering system.
Exploring deep learning techniques like RNNs or Transformers for further accuracy improvements.
